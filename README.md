EasyBundle is a simple Java library which supports internationalization. The library is dedicated for desktop applications.

The library consists of the basic elements:
* Bundles - objects that store texts
* Factories - responsible for creating bundles
* Managers - responsible for the management of bundles
* Bundles change listener - interface for objects that use bundles

All interaction between objects are described in the [JavaDocs](http://easy-bundle.projects.gabrys.biz/1.0/apidocs). Start reading from [BundleManager](http://easy-bundle.projects.gabrys.biz/1.0/apidocs/index.html?biz/gabrys/easybundle/BundleManager.html).
